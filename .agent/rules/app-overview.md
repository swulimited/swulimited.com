App overview

The app is named "swulimited.com".
The purpose of this app is to provide a web UI to simulate a sealed event for the trading card game
Star Wars Unlimited.

During a sealed event, a player has to create a deck with at least 30 cards.
Each player must use cards he/she got after opening 6 booster packs.
In Star Wars Unlimited, a booster pack is made of 16 cards.

You cannot create a deck using cards that you didn't get from those 6 booster packs.

The app helps players by providing a way to run sealed events using only a browser.
The app takes care of simulating the content of the booster packs.
Then, players can create a deck by selecting the cards they want to include.
