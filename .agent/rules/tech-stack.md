Technical stack


The language used by default is TypeScript.
Never use `var`, always use `const` or `let`.

Rely on Nuxt.js 4 as the main framework.
Leverage Tailwind CSS for styling.
Use a responsive design.

The app cannot leverage a server component (such as Node.js):
Make sure everything works with a plain HTTP server.
